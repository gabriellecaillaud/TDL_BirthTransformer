# TDL_BirthTransformer

This project was made by Gabrielle Caillaud and Damien for the course Theoretical Deep Learning Fundamentals (TDL) at CentraleSup√©lec.
We made our report and our poster available on this GitHub repo, as well as our code.

This project provides an analysis of the following paper:
Bietti, A., Cabannes, V., Bouchacourt, D., Jegou, H., & Bottou, L. (2024). Birth of a transformer: A memory viewpoint. Advances in Neural Information Processing Systems, 36.

We reused and modified the code provided by the original authors.
